\item {The following is the equation used to calculate the standard deviation for a list of integers.}
\item {Steps:}
\item {1. Find the mean of the set of integers.}
\item {2. Subtract each of the integers by the mean and square the difference.}
\item {3. Add these outcomes up and divide the sum by the number of integers.}
\item {4. Square root the divisor and you have your standard deviation.}
